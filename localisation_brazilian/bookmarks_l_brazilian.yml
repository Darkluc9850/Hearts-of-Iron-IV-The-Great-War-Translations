 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Breve História"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "A Tempestade"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Tempos sombrios estão por vir. Na Europa, Hitler consolidou seu poder e sua atenção está agora cada vez mais atraída para além da fronteira alemã. A Itália de Mussolini continua a embarcar em aventuras militares ousadas, enquanto o Império do Japão está pronto para atacar a China na Asia. Quase vinte anos se passaram desde o fim da Grande Guerra, e o mundo mais uma vez foi mergulhado em gasolina. Uma simples faísca pode ser tudo que é necessário."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "Acertando o Ventilador"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Sim, é isso ai! Aquela coleção de guarda-chuvas pode cair bem agora."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mesmo tendo o Reino Unido saído vitorioso da Grande Guerra, a fundação de seu grande império foi turbulento internamente. A geração dos melhores do país foi perdida nas trincheiras de Flandres e Norte da França, enquanto os distúrbios espalhados por toda a Commonwealth e dívidas maciças se acumularam.\n\nCom o trauma da última guerra ainda fresca na memória, o país enfrenta agora a perspectiva de outro. Está ficando cada vez mais claro que não haverá Paz para o Nosso Tempo."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Apesar da devastação da Grande Guerra, a França está no caminho da recuperação graças a sua forte economia. No entanto, a Depressão ainda afeta o país e o novo regime alemão não tem interesse em pagar as reparações de guerra estipuladas pelo Tratado de Versalhes.\n\nQuando o tratado foi assinado, um famoso renomado marechal francês comentou que não era paz, mas Um armistício de 20 anos. Esses 20 anos estão se esgotando rapidamente."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Uma nova Alemanha se ergueu. Três anos se passaram desde que a República de Weimar foi desmantelada e substituída pelo Terceiro Reich de Hitler. A estabilidade econômica voltou após os anos difíceis da Grande Depressão e o desemprego em massa foi resolvido.\n\nAs restrições militares impostas à Alemanha pelo Tratado de Versalhes foram há muito esquecidas, e a Wehrmacht se fortalece a cada dia. Outra Weltkrieg está no horizonte.
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Com o crescimento do fascismo, a Itália entrou numa nova era gloriosa. Suas forças estão atualmente no processo de adicionar a Etiópia ao crescente império colonial italiano, mas as ambições de Mussolini não param por aí.\n\nO dominio sobre o Mediterrâneo sempre foi o destino da Itália, e uma nova ordem das coisas está tomando forma na Europa. Quando a onda de mudança chegar, a Itália deve encontrar um lugar em sua crista, ou correr o risco de ser varrida."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
