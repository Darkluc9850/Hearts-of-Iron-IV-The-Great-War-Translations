 tank_unlocker1_desc:0 "In the 15th century, a Hussite called Jan Žižka won several battles using armoured wagons containing cannon that could be fired through holes in their sides. But his invention was not used after his lifetime until the 20th century. In 1903, a French artillery captain named Levavasseur proposed the Levavasseur project, a self-propelled cannon, moved by a caterpillar system and fully armoured for protection."

 tank_unlocker2_desc:0 "World War I generated new demands for armoured self-propelled weapons which could navigate any kind of terrain, and this led to the development of the tank. The great weakness of the tank's predecessor, the armoured car, was that it required smooth terrain to move upon."

 TANK_UNLOCKER_SPECIAL:0 "The development of Tank Prototype is an essential prerequisite for the development of Tanks. This must be researched before you can research advanced tank"
 TANK_UNLOCKER_RESEARCHED:0 "Allows researching tank technologies"

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_1_desc:0 "At the beginning of the 20th century, the first military armored vehicles were manufactured, by adding armor and weapons to existing vehicles."

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_2_desc:0 "A military armored (or armoured) car is a lightweight wheeled armored fighting vehicle, historically employed for reconnaissance, armed escort, and other subordinate battlefield tasks."

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_3_desc:0 "With the gradual decline of mounted cavalry, armored cars were developed for carrying out duties formerly assigned to horsemen."

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_4_desc:0 "Following the invention of the tank, the armored car remained popular due to its comparatively simplified maintenance and low production cost."

 ww1_armored_car_equipment_5_desc:0 "Since the Treaty of Versailles did not mention armored cars, Germany began developing them early. By the start of the new war, the German army possessed some highly effective reconnaissance vehicles, such as the Schwerer Panzerspähwagen."
